uv add cookiecutter
cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
-------------------------
# uv add dvc # dvc local
# uv add dvc[s3] # remote s3
# uv add dvclive # experiments tracking like mlflow

1. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
2. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
3. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
4. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
9. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
10. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
11. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
12. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
13. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
14. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.

Building Pipeline:
1> Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).
3> Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dcv pipeline (without params)
5> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6> dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
7> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dcv pipeline (with params)
8> add params.yaml file
9> Add the params setup (mentioned below)
10> Do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline along with the params
11> Now git add, commit, push

Expermients with DVC:
12> pip install dvclive
13> Add the dvclive code block (mentioned below)
14> Do "dvc exp run", it will create a new dvc.yaml(if already not there) and dvclive directory (each run will be considered as an experiment by DVC)
15> Do "dvc exp show" on terminal to see the experiments or use extension on VSCode (install dvc extension)
16> Do "dvc exp remove {exp-name}" to remove exp (optional) | "dvc exp apply {exp-name}" to reproduce prev exp
17> Change params, re-run code (produce new experiments)
18> Now git add, commit, push
